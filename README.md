# MNIST-classification-using-MLP
The Multiple feed forward algorithm is used for classifiying digits(0-9) in the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises of handwritten digits which we need to predict and tell its real number.  The link for the dataset is http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
Additionally a convulutional autoencoder is trained for correctness and robustness of this model.
